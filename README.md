# N-Queens-and-Obstacles
Modified version of N-Queens problem

You are a zookeeper in the reptile house. One of your rare South Pacific Tufted Wizzo lizards
(Tufticus Wizzocus) has just had several babies. Your job is to find a place to put each baby lizard in a nursery.

However, there is a catch, the baby lizards have very long tongues. A baby lizard can shoot out
its tongue and eat any other baby lizard before you have time to save it. As such, you want to
make sure that no baby lizard can eat another baby lizard in the nursery (burp).

For each baby lizard, you can place them in one spot on a grid. From there, they can shoot out
their tongue up, down, left, right and diagonally as well. Their tongues are very long and can
reach to the edge of the nursery from any location.

In addition to baby lizards, your nursery may have some trees planted in it. Your lizards cannot
shoot their tongues through the trees nor can you move a lizard into the same place as a tree. 
As such, a tree will block any lizard from eating another lizard if it is in the path. 
Additionally, the tree will block you from moving the lizard to that location.

To find the solution you will use the following algorithms:
- Breadth-first search (BFS)
- Depth-first search (DFS)
- Simulated annealing (SA).
